                    Dear Ash baby,<br>
                    They say love comes when you least expect it and I guess it's true. When I met you on the 18th of April I never thought I'd find the one anytime soon, though I was open to a relationship I never expected a lot to save myself trouble. I firmly believed that God would send someone my way once he decides that I am worthy of taking one of his daughters in marriage. I never expected it to come so soon but here we are. <br><br>
        
                    When I found out you're a Catholic I thought "maybe it's her but it's too soon to conclude" then the more I spent time with you the more I realised that you are my prayers answered. I prayed that our Father in Heaven sends me a suitable partner once he believes I am worthy of one. <br><br>
        
                    I thought that for this to be a special message I should simply be myself. I've tried many times to find the right words and make things right. I tried to play guitar many times for you as part of my surprise but it was never good enough for me. I tried to draw you but I thought it needed to be original, something authentic. So I simply came up with this web page. Originally it was meant to depict all our adventures and life together but due to time constraints I am unable to fully go over every moment I want to share with you. So I will list some of them. <br><br>
        
                    I would love to be your rock, the one you can depend on, one who sticks to you during your ups and downs. I want to be that alarm who wakes you up in the morning covered in kisses and snuggles. I want to be your greatest confidant, your best friend and lover. I want to feed you everyday, take care of you with love and kindness. I seek to follow you everywhere you go as long as it pleases you, to the bathroom, restroom, outside and inside. I want to be by your side at all time. I want to be the pillow you cry on and the one who comforts you. I believe there's not much to say. Everything is obvious to you, you are beautiful, smart, kind, honest, loving and cute. You are a loving yandere at heart, a mother without kids and wife without husband. But today I would like to change that. <br><br>
